## Detailed Progress

### Phase 1: Critical Database Security ✅ COMPLETE
**Commit**: `85e29fb`

**What Was Fixed**:
1. **Critical**: Removed hardcoded database credentials (security vulnerability)
2. Created `brandme_core/db.py` with centralized database utilities
3. Standardized DATABASE_URL usage across all 7 services
4. Added health checks with database connectivity verification
5. Implemented graceful connection pool shutdown

**Services Updated**: All Python services  
**Security Impact**: 🔴 HIGH → 🟡 MEDIUM

---

### Phase 2: HTTP Retry Logic & Environment Management ✅ COMPLETE
**Commit**: `09d49e5`

**What Was Added**:
1. Created `brandme_core/http_client.py` with exponential backoff retry (up to 3 attempts)
2. Created `brandme_core/env.py` for environment variable management
3. Removed hardcoded service URLs (now environment-based)
4. Updated all service-to-service calls with retry logic
5. Added `brandme_core/graceful_shutdown.py` for resource cleanup

**Services Updated**: brain, policy, orchestrator  
**Reliability Impact**: Transient failures now auto-recover

---

### Phase 3: Security Hardening ✅ COMPLETE
**Commit**: `e56942e`

**What Was Implemented**:
1. **Authentication middleware** (`brandme_gateway/src/middleware/auth.ts`)
   - JWT validation
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - User context propagation

2. **Rate limiting** (`brandme_gateway/src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts`)
   - Token bucket algorithm
   - 100 req/min global limit
   - 10 req/min for scan endpoints
   - Rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-*)

3. **Secure CORS configuration** (`brandme_core/cors_config.py`)
   - Environment-based origins
   - Production-safe defaults
   - Configurable via environment variables

4. **Enhanced security**:
   - Helmet with Content Security Policy
   - Request body size limits (1MB)
   - Secure headers
   - Origin validation

**Services Updated**: Gateway + all Python services  
**Security Impact**: 🟡 MEDIUM → 🟢 LOW

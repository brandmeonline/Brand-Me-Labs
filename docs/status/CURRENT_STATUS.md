- ✅ JWT authentication middleware implemented
- ✅ Token bucket rate limiting (100/min global, 10/min scan)
- ✅ Secure CORS configuration with origin validation
- ✅ Enhanced security headers (CSP, XSS protection)
- ✅ Request body size limits (1MB)

**Impact**: Enterprise-grade authentication and protection

---

### Phase 4: Observability ✅ COMPLETE (Infrastructure)
**Commits**: `019b52f`, `65eb987`, `c0f1555`

- ✅ Prometheus metrics exposed on all services
- ✅ OpenTelemetry tracing ready

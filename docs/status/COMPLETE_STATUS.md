**Date**: January 27, 2025

**What Was Implemented**:
1. JWT authentication middleware (`brandme_gateway/src/middleware/auth.ts`)
2. Token bucket rate limiting (`brandme_gateway/src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts`)
   - 100 req/min global limit
   - 10 req/min for scan endpoints
3. Secure CORS configuration with origin validation
4. Content Security Policy headers via helmet
5. Request body size limits (1MB)
6. Updated all services with secure CORS

**Impact**: Enterprise-grade authentication and protection

### Phase 4: Observability Infrastructure âœ… 80% COMPLETE
**Commits**: `019b52f`, `65eb987`, `c0f1555`  
**Date**: January 27, 2025

**What Was Added**:
1. Prometheus metrics utilities (`brandme_core/metrics.py`)
2. OpenTelemetry tracing utilities (`brandme_core/telemetry.py`)
3. `/metrics` endpoint on all 7 Python services
4. Metrics integration in health checks
5. Updated requirements.txt with observability dependencies

**Remaining**:
- Business metrics instrumentation (20%)
- Prometheus server deployment
- Grafana dashboards
- Alert rules

**Impact**: Full observability infrastructure ready

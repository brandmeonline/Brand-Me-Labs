# Lane brief: astra-consumer-ui

**Bench:** Astra (Codex) · **Branch:** `bench/astra-consumer-ui-20261005`
**Base:** `docs/brandme-full-experience-2026-10-05` · **Spec:** `docs/design/brandme/` + `contracts/`
**Work packages:** W01-shell/UI, W03-UI (onboarding + Looking Glass), W05-UI (social/loyalty), W06-UI (discovery), W07-UI (assistant/checkout), W10-UI (my data)
**Position in merge order:** After `opus-foundation` merges (needs `packages/design-system` tokens + generated API clients). Independent of Lane 6 (disjoint routes/features).

## What you are building
The consumer frontend — 40+ routes, the app shell, Looking Glass persona controls, social decision flows, the trusted checkout surface, discovery, and My Data screens. Read chapters 01, 02, 06 and the root `CLAUDE.md` first. Use the design tokens and screen/scene choreography as implementation requirements.

## You own exclusively (no other lane may touch these)
- `brandme-frontend/app/` — ALL routes EXCEPT `closet/**`, `try/**`, `add/**`, `style/**` (those are Lane 6)
- `brandme-frontend/app/layout.tsx`, `brandme-frontend/app/globals.css`
- `brandme-frontend/{lib,components}/`, `brandme-frontend/tailwind.config.js`
- `brandme-frontend/features/{persona,outfits,social,rewards,commerce,ownership,privacy}/`
- `brandme-console/` shell: `app/layout.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`, shared `components/`, `lib/` — PLUS publish your layout contract for domain pages in this status file BEFORE backend lanes build their `app/(ops)/**` subtrees

## Read-only for you (import, never modify)
`packages/design-system` (consume tokens; token gaps → request in this status file, never direct edits), `packages/contracts` (generated clients), `brandme-frontend/features/{spatial,closet}/` (Lane 6 — may import, never modify).

## Forbidden
Any `brandme_core/`, `brandme-data/`, `brandme-chain/`, or `brandme-gateway/` files. `docs/design/brandme/**`, `contracts/**`.

## Exit evidence (from ch.06 §2, UI portions)
- Shell renders at 390×844, 768×1024, 1440×900, plus 320px with no horizontal overflow; keyboard navigation throughout; reduced-motion removes camera flights/parallax while preserving state changes; dark-mode tokens verified; 200% zoom + large text usable
- Onboarding: useful first reveal in ~90 seconds, no wallet/camera/contacts required; guest migration idempotent (sign in twice → no duplicated rewards/wardrobe)
- Looking Glass: all 12 axes inspectable/editable, declared/inferred/effective separation, locks, evidence suppression, snapshots, reset; changes persist via the domain API (a refresh never reverts to mock data); recommendation explanations reflect actual scoring
- Social: five-minute server-timed decision composer with countdown; yes/pass/alternative responses; friend outfit proposals; sanitized share cards; blocks/revokes remove access
- Checkout: trusted confirmation surface with exact totals (deterministic panel — never model prose); price-changed and expired states handled
- My Data: inspection/edit/export/delete flows; consent revocation; derived-data suppression
- Visual QA: fix visible issues in screenshots before calling complete; fidelity labels on every preview type (photo-in-3D vs generative vs body overlay vs calibrated fit — never label generative imagery as calibrated fit)

## Cross-lane note
The visual outfit editor straddles Lane 5 (`features/outfits` — lists, proposals) and Lane 6 (3D composition). Rule: Lane 6 builds it as an embeddable component; you import it read-only. Confirm the component interface with Lane 6 via status files.

## Status protocol
Record status ONLY in this file. Propose deviations here. Publish your console shell layout contract here early.

## Global rules (all lanes)
Never edit another lane's owned files. Never edit `docs/design/brandme/**` or `contracts/**`. No `latest` tags — pin everything. Demo fixtures carry visible simulation labels. Never label generative imagery as calibrated fit.

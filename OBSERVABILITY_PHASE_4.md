# Brand.Me Labs - Observability Phase 4
## Metrics, Tracing, and Monitoring Implementation

**Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Phase**: 4 - Observability & Monitoring  
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS

---

## What's Being Implemented

### Phase 4: Observability & Monitoring

#### 1. Prometheus Metrics âœ… STARTED
- HTTP request metrics (count, duration)
- Database connection metrics
- Service-to-service call metrics
- Business metrics (scans, policy decisions, escalations)
- Error tracking
- Health check status
- Metrics endpoint on all services

#### 2. OpenTelemetry Tracing â¬œ PLANNED
- Distributed tracing setup
- Span creation for all operations
- Service call trace propagation
- Error recording in spans
- OTLP exporter configuration

#### 3. Enhanced Logging â¬œ PLANNED
- Structured logging with trace IDs
- Correlation IDs
- Log levels with sampling
- Centralized log aggregation prep

#### 4. Alert Rules â¬œ PLANNED
- Service availability alerts
- Error rate alerts
- Database connection alerts
- High latency alerts

## Implementation Progress

### âœ… Created Utilities
- `brandme_core/metrics.py` - Prometheus metrics collection
- `brandme_core/telemetry.py` - OpenTelemetry tracing
- Updated `brandme_core/requirements.txt` with dependencies

### â¬œ In Progress
- Adding /metrics endpoints to all Python services
- Instrumenting key operations with metrics
- Adding tracing to service calls

### â¬œ Planned
- Grafana dashboard creation
- Alert rule configuration
- Log aggregation setup
- APM integration

## Metrics Exposed

### HTTP Metrics
- `http_requests_total` - Total HTTP requests by method, endpoint, status, service
- `http_request_duration_seconds` - HTTP request duration histogram

### Database Metrics
- `db_connections_active` - Active database connections
- `db_query_duration_seconds` - Database query duration histogram

### Service Call Metrics
- `service_calls_total` - Service-to-service call counts
- `service_call_duration_seconds` - Service call duration histogram

### Business Metrics
- `scans_total` - Garment scan events
- `policy_decisions_total` - Policy decisions
- `escalations_total` - Escalation events

### Error Metrics
- `errors_total` - Error occurrences by type

### Health Metrics
- `health_check_status` - Component health status

## Next Steps

1. Add /metrics endpoint to all services
2. Instrument key operations with metrics collection
3. Configure OpenTelemetry tracing
4. Create Prometheus configuration
5. Set up Grafana dashboards
6. Configure alert rules

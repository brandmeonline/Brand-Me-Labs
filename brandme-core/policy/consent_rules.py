Consent Rules Module
====================

Determines what data can be shown based on consent and relationship between
scanner and garment owner.

Scope levels:
- public: Anyone can view (ESG data, brand info, public certifications)
- friends_only: Only friends of the owner can view (ownership history, provenance)
- private: Only the owner can view (purchase price, wallet details, personal notes)

- [ ] Store wallet keys securely
- [ ] Implement secret rotation policies

#### 4. CI/CD Enhancement
- [ ] Add actual test execution (not stubbed)
- [ ] Implement coverage reporting
- [ ] Add security scanning (Trivy, Snyk)
- [ ] Create deployment playbooks

### Future Enhancements (4-8 weeks)

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Local Testing (Today)
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify health checks
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # brain
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # policy
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # orchestrator
curl http://localhost:8003/health  # knowledge
curl http://localhost:8004/health  # compliance
curl http://localhost:8005/health  # identity
curl http://localhost:8006/health  # governance

# Test authentication (requires Bearer token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer test-token" http://localhost:3000/scan
```

### 2. Development Environment (This Week)
```bash
# Deploy to dev
make deploy-dev

# Run smoke tests
make test-smoke

# Monitor logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/brandme-gateway -n brandme-dev
```

### 3. Production Deployment (After Testing)
```bash
# Apply production configuration
helm upgrade --install brandme ./brandme-infra/helm/brandme-umbrella \
  --values values/values-prod.yaml \
  --namespace brandme \
  --create-namespace

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -n brandme
kubectl get services -n brandme
```

  curl http://localhost:$port/health
done
```

### Test Authentication
```bash
# Generate test token (for dev only)
TOKEN="dev-token-$(date +%s)"

# Test scan endpoint
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"garment_tag":"test-123"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/scan
